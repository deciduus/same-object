## [2026-09-03] correction | G11 statolith energy was wrong by ~100x

The note claimed a single statolith displacement costs **2–3 k_BT**. Recomputed from Bérut
et al. 2018 (PNAS 115:5123): buoyant mass 1.91×10⁻¹⁴ kg, d = 4.5 μm, so mgd = 8.4×10⁻¹⁹ J
= **~205 k_BT**. The check: this gives Pe⁻¹ = 4.9×10⁻³, inside the paper's stated 3–8×10⁻³.

2–3 k_BT is roughly the cost of a **66 nm** displacement — a derived *threshold*, not the
*cost* of a displacement. The two were conflated.

## [2026-09-03] restored | G11 withdrawn → narrowed, evidence full-text-read

The withdrawal cited Miyamoto 2007 as a limits-to-sensing analysis. It is an experiment
(flax roots, 5 Hz, 0.5 mm oscillation). A withdrawal misdescribed its own source — the exact
failure the symmetry rule was written to catch, caught only by reading.

## [2026-09-03] vocabulary | evidence gains full-text-read

Ranked between citation-intersection and string-protocol. Means the primary sources were
read, not counted. Added because [[G11-plant-gravisensing]] had no honest grade available:
three papers read in full is not `single-review` and is plainly stronger than
`string-protocol`. Enforced by `_lint.py`.

## [2026-09-03] atomic-schema migration | 20 gap notes converted

Prose frontmatter replaced with filterable data. `contact-surface: "0 crossings, both
directions"` became `contact-surface: 0` plus `crosses`, `crosses-rank`, `topology`,
`mediator`. Six typed directional edge fields added. Tag mirrors added.

Reason: prose in a machine field cannot be sorted, filtered, or linted. The defect that
prompted it — [[verdict-scoring]] was marked retired while a gap still carried
`status: holds` — was a retired word sitting in current frontmatter with nothing to catch it.

## [2026-09-03] lint extended | atomic vocabularies enforced

`_lint.py` now checks the `crosses` vocabulary, that `crosses-rank` agrees with `crosses`,
the `topology` vocabulary, that `mediated` and the `mediator` field agree, that
`contact-surface` is a bare integer, and that all six edge fields are present.

## [2026-09-03] graph and Bases added | zero plugins

`triage.base` and [[graph-view]]. Both are core Obsidian. Bases reads YAML frontmatter only,
which is why the migration had to land first.
